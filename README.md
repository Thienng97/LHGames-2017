## Game AI

The goal of the LHGames was to develop an AI that would interact in a video game developped by the event organizers. The AI had to collect minerals, steal from other houses, rack up points, buy upgrades and weapons, avoid death and obstacles, be able to fight other AIs.

## Team Je_cherche_un_stage

This project was made by the following people:
* Duc-Thien Nguyen
* Salim Eid
* Tommy Trinh

## Motivation

The event was an opportunity to learn a new programming language as well as work on developping our software design skills.

## What it does

Currently the AI is able to move the player to collect resources and drops them off at home once player capacity is full. Decision making, such as what to do and when to do it, has been hardcoded due to lack of time during the hackathon.

## Challenges we ran into

The provided Python base was incomplete and the parts that were complete has a few problems. Since it was also our first time actually working in Python, we spent more time debugging, whether it be syntax or actual features, than properly coding.

## How we worked

We had started working by dividing tasks and combining the different functionnalities together as we had them ready. However, we soon ran into problems because of the testing server only working on one computer. Also, debugging was much easier once we started working on the same device. Six eyes are better than two! And so early on we started designing our code on paper, and translating it to python using only one computer.
